					<h2 id="chapter01:socialimplications">Chapter 01: Social Implications</h2>

					<p>The span of graphic design is not a history of concepts but of forms. Form has evolved dramatically from one year to the next, and suggests a profession that continually revises and reshapes the world through the way it is rendered. — Michael Rock, Fuck Content.<p>

<p>"If man is shaped by his surroundings, his surroundings must be made human” 
— Z.A. Jordan</p>

<p>Form is the basic substance through which everything is made visible, and is the visual shape and configuration of any object, plane, or element that exists in our ocular perception. This could suggest that form may also be one of the most fundamental aspects in how reality is composed, and how we establish a relationship between how we perceive our surroundings, and how we shape our surroundings. Believing in this notion also poses an incredible amount of control over what we see, and how we react to these visual configurations that frame the world. Referring to Michael Rock's essay titled “Fuck Content”, he states: “This deep connection to making also positions design in a modulating role between the user and the world. By manipulating form, design reshapes that essential relationship. Form is replaced by exchange. The things we make negotiate a relationship over which we have profound control.</p>
 
<p>Style could be identified as the visual properties through which an object is rendered. It is the visual synthesis of the addressed elements, function, techniques, expressions, syntax, and the overall form of the object. While it remains difficult and complex to pin down a single, clear definition for this universal principle. The best way to formulate a clear definition in terms of visual literacy may very well be to regard it as a class or category of visual expression which is shaped by the sum of it’s parts, and the cultural sphere which influences it.</p>

<p>Throughout history, graphic design has evolved primarily as an artistic and communicative discipline which has been developed through the practice and development of visual forms. A graphic designer is often described as an individual who gives shape to information through visual, artistic, and linguistic means through a variety of mediums, solutions, and techniques. At the intersection of a any legitimate design process, we outline a bond between both form and content; The engine, the fuel, the essence. Embedded in the vehicle which transports this content. We (automatically) refer to this vehicle as the form. Attached to this; are a specifically determined set of parameters which ultimately define the outcome of the object. Through it’s intention, function, context, and overall form as a result of the determined standards and guidelines in a design process. The substance of form in graphic design however, ultimately gravitates towards the notion of a visual “language”, or a visual syntax; And a language is defined by a system that addresses both style and substance, both form and content. In order for this result to take place, the work has to first enter a process of organisation, hierarchisation, and research in the relation between form and respective content. Jonas Berthod had very recently published an essay as part of his course taught at the ECAL titled ‘Research In Design’; whereby he quotes one of Alain Findeli’s essential research approaches: “Firstly, what do we want to know about the world in relation to design? Secondly, what is the specificity of the look that the design casts over the world….? Thirdly, what new or different… aspect does the look of the design…. deliver? What are the research questions, the objects of investigation, unique to the design?”.</p>

<p>Based on the aforementioned quote and urgent argument posed by Alain Findeli; we gather a sense of critical revision where we pose questions on the relevance of graphic design discourse. Where developments are questioned into a validation process where we class the importance of certain decisions, and their benefits, implications, or complications within socially implicit discourse. To which, a fundamental aspect of the practice is the re-assessment of the significance of graphic design; in relation to cultural, social, political, and economical circumstances. How should graphic design be perceived by both society, and it’s practitioners? How do these concerns motivate new questions towards new discoveries of forms, and investigation towards new aesthetics?</p>

<p>As a result, we often find ourselves questioning the value of the craft, and the function of graphic design at large. We engage in critical discussions through which we assess graphic design discourse in relation to the aforementioned past and current social profiles. But what exactly is the essence of these inquiries? By researching different modes of representation, we aim to further our knowledge of meaning and the significant; through the use of language and images. And in this process, we aim to create meaning and mark our work with reasoning, purpose, and a personal and social value in the process of reaching these discoveries. In efforts of responding to these inquiries, the contemporary Graphic Design practice has expanded enormously and entirely superseded it’s conventional borders by whole heartedly crossing into other fields of applied arts while also adhering to a strong culture of communication driven by the wave of new media; and the vast amount of possibilities available at hand through the basic notion that all digital and design tools have been completely democratised and are developing on a broad spectrum of sporadic tangents from DIY cultures to commercial software developers. Ultimately driving the ongoing research towards form and visual languages that are developing in parallel with the intellectual counterpart of the practice in a highly anticipated climate of contemporary design.</p>

					<p>“If the audience has changed and the production has changed, and the messages might change, wouldn’t common sense suggest that the notion of form might evolve too?” 
					— Lorraine Wild</p>

					<p>“What supposedly distinguishes humans from their primate ancestors is their ability not to use tools but to integrate them into everyday activities, find fresh uses for them, and to create new ones.”</p>

					<p>“The tool in effect transforms our material and virtual realities and, by doing so, it transforms us.”
					— Andrew Blauvelt</p>

					<p>Looking back at the developments of aesthetic forms throughout the discourse of visual culture, and the sphere of graphic design at large; we can clearly identify different aesthetic classes through various movements, motives, time periods, and technological advancements which have ultimately defined themselves through a visual syntax derived from cultural connotation, and tools through which they have been rendered. A vast amount of visual vocabularies in a sporadic discourse through time, from the barbaric cave drawings and hieroglyphic symbols, to the height of modernist ideologies and the Bauhaus ethics, to the over saturated image based culture of the postmodern era..To be continued</p>
