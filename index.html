                <h1>Abstract (ALL TEXT BOUND TO REVISION AND CORRECTIONS, NOT YET COMPLETE.)</h1>



            </div>
<p>Graphic Design has evolved throughout history as an artistic and communicative discipline which has originated through the practice and development of visual forms. However, the practice of Graphic Design today has expanded far beyond it’s conventional borders, and through this it has also gained an ephemeral body and experienced a shift in the value of form, and the mastery of craft alike. In this respect, graphic design has been re-casted as a discipline which is primarily bound to a research driven agenda. Where the producing of content has gained a higher value than that of shaping it. And that good design is judged by good content, as opposed to a criteria adhering to craft itself, and the process of shaping content. While the decentralisation of the graphic design practice from it’s conventional model could very well owe it’s reform to the social, technological, and economical developments. This change has in turn also affected the ways in which we value form and craft in a contemporary climate of graphic design.</p>

<p>“Suddenly design isn’t really about design anymore, and craft and form are depreciated in the face of “analysis” and “understanding”. This appears to be a halfhearted attempt to recast design as a primarily quantitive and analytics discipline. Yes, design is about analysis and problem solving, but it’s fundamental impact on the world (for better or worse) is in the artefacts of forms it produces. This is the only way ideas survive in design. To denigrate form and artefact making in design is to destroy it’s essence and reduce it to a generic role of think tank or consultant.”<p>

<p>“This false dichotomy has circulated for so long that we have started to believe it ourselves. It has become a central tenet of design education and the benchmark against which all design is judged. We seem to accept the fact that developing content is more essential than shaping it, that good content is the measure of good design”</p> 

<p>The thesis aims to stimulate a discussion around this shift in practice. How do we restore the value of form and craft within graphic design? How do we continue to shape to our surroundings? And how do we pose questions towards the development of new forms and new aesthetics?</p></div>

                <h1>Introduction — Graphic Design: A Practice of Forms</h1>

                <p>Chapter 01</p>

            </div>
            <p><em> "The span of graphic design is not a history of concepts but of forms. Form has evolved dramatically from one year to the next, and suggests a profession that continually revises and reshapes the world through the way it is rendered." — Michael Rock, Fuck Content.
			<br><br>
					"If man is shaped by his surroundings, his surroundings must be made human” 
					— Z.A. Jordan</p></em>

         
		 <p>Form is the basic substance through which everything is made visible, and is the visual shape and configuration of any object, plane, or element that exists in our ocular perception. This could suggest that form may also be one of the most fundamental aspects in how reality is composed, and how we establish a relationship between how we perceive our surroundings, and how we shape our surroundings. Believing in this notion also poses a responsibility over what we see, and how we react to the visual configurations that frame the&nbspworld.<a href="#1x1"><sup>&nbsp1</sup></a> In Michael Rock's essay titled "Fuck Content", he elaborates on this notion by stating that "This deep connection to making also positions design in a modulating role between the user and the world. By manipulating form, design reshapes that essential relationship. Form is replaced by exchange. The things we make negotiate a relationship over which we have profound</em>&nbspcontrol".<a href="#1x2"> <sup>&nbsp2</sup></a></p></p>

            <p>Additionally, a style could be identified as the visual properties through which an object is rendered. It is the visual synthesis of the addressed elements, function, techniques, expressions, and syntax which contribute to the overall form of the work. It remains difficult and complex to pin down a single, universal translation of form. The best way to formulate a clear definition in terms of visual literacy may very well be to view it as a class or category of visual expression. Which is shaped by the sum of it’s parts, and the cultural sphere which influences  </em>&nbspit.<a href="#1x3"><sup>&nbsp3</sup></a></p>

            	<p>The aforementioned paragraph aims to frame a clear definition of what form represents throughout the thesis. As to avoid confusion with the physical form of an object. But rather the two-dimensional paradigm of forms which in essence; is the most vital and prominent aspect of graphic design as practice. With this; the following chapters aim to further investigate the value of form in what appears to be a highly dispersed, unbalanced, but sporadically constructive stage for visual developments in graphic design discourse. Where boundaries are hard to place, technological limitations are never an issue, and an eclectic wave of visual languages and forms have emerged throughout the last decades in Graphic Design.
					
					
					<p>Throughout history, graphic design has evolved primarily as an artistic and communicative discipline which has progressed through the practice and development of visual forms.<a href="#1x4"> <sup>&nbsp4</sup></a> The graphic designer is often described as an individual who gives shape to information through visual, artistic, and linguistic means; through a limitless variety of mediums, solutions, and combinations of techniques. At the intersection of any legitimate design process, we outline a formal bond between both form and content; The essential equation which allows for a work of graphic design to manifest itself, and exist with purpose and intent. Where form cannot exist without content, and content cannot exist without form.<a href="#1x5"> <sup>&nbsp5</sup></a> The combination of these two components celebrate a marriage within the project’s framework. Therefore contributing to an end result which consists of an equal balance between the arrangement of visual forms which materialise it; and the intellectual component, the content, which contextualises the work. Ultimately transmitting a message in the optimal form determined by the designer and his personal taste, social agenda, and personal value in the work. Form follows function, or, form follows content… Content is transposed into the vehicle which makes this body of content visible; this vehicle is commonly referred to as form. Incapsulating a series of visual properties which co-exist in picture or a surface to form the total visual syntax of a design or image. Defined by it’s format, it’s aesthetic properties, and the medium through which the work is ultimately received by an audience. Attached to the design process itself are a specifically determined set of parameters defined by the designer, which ultimately establish the set of guidelines which determine the outcome of the work. Through it’s intention, function, context, and overall artistic rendering produced through the designers artistic and intellectual capacity, as well as the design tools at his complete and entire disposal.</p> 
					
					<p>Furthermore, the substance of form in graphic design ultimately gravitates towards the notion of a visual language, or a visual syntax; And a language is defined by a system that addresses both style and substance, both form and content.<a href="#1xX"> <sup>&nbspX</sup></a> In order for this result to take place, the work of graphic design has to first enter a process of research, hierarchisation, and total organisation of form and content. Jonas Berthod had very recently published an essay as part of his course taught at the ECAL titled ‘Research In Design’; whereby he quotes one of Alain Findeli’s essential research inquiries: “Firstly, what do we want to know about the world in relation to design? Secondly, what is the specificity of the look that the design casts over the world….? Thirdly, what new or different… aspect does the look of the design…. deliver? What are the research questions, the objects of investigation, unique to the design?”.<a href="#1x6"> <sup>&nbsp6</sup></a></p>
					
					<p>Based on the aforementioned quote and urgent observation posed by Alain Findeli we gather a sense of responsibility towards critically revising our practice. Where we pose questions on the relevance of graphic design discourse in efforts of facilitating a process which reflects both the interest of the designer, as well as the social context for which it is designed for. Where developments are questioned into a validation process, and where we class the importance of certain design decisions. Their benefits, implications, or complications within a socially implicit discourse. To which, a fundamental aspect of the practice is the re-assessment of the significance of graphic design; it’s relation to cultural, social, political, and economical circumstances. How should graphic design be perceived by both society, and it’s practitioners? How do these concerns motivate new questions towards the discoveries of new forms, and investigation towards new aesthetics?.<a href="#1x7"> <sup>&nbsp7</sup></a></p>
					

			<p>We often find ourselves questioning the value of craft, and the function of graphic design at large. We engage in critical discussions through which we assess graphic design discourse in relation to the aforementioned social profiles, technological developments, and economical circumstances. But what exactly is the essence of these inquiries? By researching different modes of representation, we aim to further our knowledge of meaning and the significant through the use of language and images.<a href="#1xX"> <sup>&nbspX</sup></a> And in this process, we aim to create meaning and mark our work with reason, purpose, and a personal as well as social value. All in the interest of reaching new discoveries.<a href="#1x8"> <sup>&nbsp8</sup></a> In efforts of responding to these inquiries, we first look at how the contemporary field of Graphic Design has expanded beyond it’s own title, boundaries, and physical limitations. And thus, entirely superseded it’s conventional borders by whole heartedly crossing into other fields of applied arts and intellectual motives. However, still adhering to a strong culture of communication driven by findings deriving from history, research, appropriation, collaboration, and a multidisciplinary agenda. With the vast scope of possibilities available at hand: from open-source DIY cultures, to the paradigm of commercial software developers. Along with the practical know-how and the global democratisation of design tools, designers from all backgrounds, interests, and qualifications are re-defining the practice of Graphic Design on what seems to be an annual if not bi-annual basis. The liquid form which the practice of graphic design has assumed, has in turn dispersed the discipline across an infinite plane of activities, in what appears to be a constant shapeshifting container.</p>

			<p>However, while the podium for graphic design discourse and aesthetic development continues to flourish in a resourceful climate of contemporary design, through it’s historical, cultural, practical, and intellectual agenda, we notice a shift in emphasis on what the graphic design practice should be identified as. And it can be argued that In the recent decade we have witnessed a shift in the practice in which concept has predominantly assumed a priority over the practice of forms. Evidently delaying the qualities which once spawned graphic design as the discipline that allowed it to reach the surface on which it rests today.</p>

            <div class="chaptertitle">
                <h1>Chapter 2.1 — Production of Form, Content or Ulterior Motives?</h1>
                <p>Chapter 02</p>
			</div>
			
            <p><em>“If the audience has changed and the production has changed, and the messages might change, wouldn’t common sense suggest that the notion of form might evolve too?” — Lorraine Wild
			<br><br>
					“What supposedly distinguishes humans from their primate ancestors is their ability not to use tools but to integrate them into everyday activities, find fresh uses for them, and to create new ones.”
			<br><br>
					“The tool in effect transforms our material and virtual realities and, by doing so, it transforms us.” — Andrew Blauvelt</p></em>
					
					<p>While the arena of contemporary Graphic Design has expanded considerably beyond it’s threshold and continues to become increasingly dispersed in it’s definition, and as a result emancipated from the conventional values which once defined it as a discipline. It has also transcended these conventional limitations by absorbing processes and motives from other artistic disciplines. In efforts of furthering its substance by absorbing foreign processes which ultimately contribute to new frameworks within the sphere of graphic design. Through the spurt of graphic design criticism in the late 1980’s, and the self-revising nature of the practice along with the global democratisation of design tools: graphic design has revised itself as a profession time and time again.</p>
					
					<p>Designers have equipped themselves with a sense of criticality towards their practice, their work, and the work of others.<a href="#1x9"> <sup>&nbsp9</sup></a> Additionally, the designer today operates in a multitude of fields. While some designers operate in providing “services”: working on a designer-to-client basis within the commercial and cultural domain. Other design practices pertaining to a more autonomous and research driven framework operate as researchers, engineers, curators, performers, artists, and activists; the latter assumes an approach advocating the ideology of ‘being your own client’, as opposed to providing a commercial service as conventionally established. The latter also conveys the decentralisation of the design practice from it’s conventional model and could very well be related to the social and technological developments in the recent decades. But also reflecting the liquid state in which graphic design has adopted. Where anyone and everyone is free to adapt graphic design to their set of criteria. Daniel van der Velden of Metahaven contextualises the latter approach with stating that  “In recent years, the graphic designer has shown himself as — what has he not shown himself to be? Artist, editor, author, initiator, skilful rhetorician, architect…. The designer is his own client, who, like Narcissus, admires himself in the mirror of the of the design books and magazines, but he is also the designer who does things besides designing, and consequently further advances his profession.”<a href="#1x10"> <sup>&nbsp10</sup></a></p>
					
					<p>The assumed, multifaceted professional traits demonstrated by the contemporary graphic designer holds qualities which should be commonly acknowledged amongst contemporary designers. To stay informed, capable, and to align ones practice with the current social,cultural, technological demands of it’s time. The informed graphic designer today has extended his practice and capabilities by recruiting secondary and even tertiary titles to his profession. The graphic designer is his own producer (as he has all the production means available at hand), he is also an author (because “Today, an important graphic design is one generated by the designer himself, a commentary on the margins of visual culture”<a href="#1x11"> <sup>&nbsp11</sup></a>), the graphic designer is also an initiator (because the graphic designer today possesses entrepreneurial capabilities as motivator and initiator).</p> 
						
					<p>However, while we understand that the practice of graphic design has elevated itself considerably within the last several decades; from a ‘problem solving and analytical’ practice, to a fully fledged intellectual power-house absorbing and addressing all that encompasses it. One should also realise that while these developments foster grand advantages. They also carry an equally steep set of disadvantages. In that, the designer who does not conform to the aforementioned processes of adhering to other professions other than his own: runs the risk of becoming marginalised in his practice. With this shift, the emphasis on the operational aspects of the practice gravitate closer to the intellectual and linguistic component of the field, rather than establishing a balanced link between the visual, aesthetic, and intellectual components; and the creation thereof. Michael Rock asserts that “In Designer As Author I argued that we are insecure about the value of our work. We are envious of the power, social position and cachet that artists and authors seem to command. By declaring ourselves “designers/authors” we hope to garner similar respect. Our deep-seated anxiety has motivated a movement in design that values origination of content over manipulation of content”.</p>


					<p>Following Michael Rock’s piece from ‘Fuck Content’; we establish a better understanding of this shift in practice. While todays standards project an appetite for the origination of content, rather than that of shaping content. We also find difficulties in locating the entry point in which we can restore graphic design to it’s original status where the designer is focused on shaping and arranging content. Rather than producing content. Furthermore, Michael Rock asserts his views through an analogy which states “that design (the glass) should be a transparent vessel for content (the wine). And anyone who sided with the former, was a superficial operator.<a href="#1x12"> <sup>&nbsp12</sup></a> “this false dichotomy has circulated for so long that we have started to believe it ourselves. It has become a central tenet of design education and the benchmark against which all design is judged. We seem to accept the fact that developing content is more essential than shaping it, that good content is the measure of good design”<a href="#1x13"> <sup>&nbsp13</sup></a>. Where in perfect conditions, the designer should be ‘designer and author’, as opposed to ‘designer as author’.<a href="#1x14"> <sup>&nbsp14</sup></a></p>
						
					<p>In Randy Nakamura’s essay titled “The Grand Unified Theory of Nothing: Design, The Cult of Science, And The Lure of Big Ideas”, he propels the previously laid argument forward. In how graphic design has been reformed as a practice governed by the notion and operational tactics of an intellectual think tank. Rather than the values which graphic design originally fostered in the initial offing of the discipline. These changes may be related to social and cultural changes — a shift in the designers responsibilities. But it may also be due to the fact that the practice of graphic design has not been defined by one universal term, and hence not guarded by parameters which contain it’s integrity and composure. Nakamura propagates this concern by saying that “Unfortunately, this legacy of concept over form has mutated over the decades into a new and strange form. Instead of merely applying “concept über alles” to actual pieces of design, designers want to engage their entire practice in this manner. This desire to turn design into a total conceptual discipline has it’s roots in the fact that the cultural and social status of design has always been up for grabs. Being neither fine art nor vernacular art, but sampling, appropriating, and utilizing both domains, design occupies an area Pierre Bourdieu calls the “sphere of the legitimizable”, the zone between high and low culture that is constantly being contested, reconfigured, and challenged.”<a href="#1x15"> <sup>&nbsp15</sup></a></p>
					
					
					
			<!-- CHAPTER 2.2 -->
	
            <div class="chaptertitle">
                <h1>Chapter 2.2 — Graphic Design: On Production</h1>
                <p>Chapter 02</p>
			</div>
	
            <p><em>"Design practice today requires the intellectual power of a think tank and the turnaround capacity of a quickie-printer." — Lorraine Wild
			<br><br>
					"Instead of collectively agreeing to the same streamlined tools sold to us by large software companies, we need to reclaim the personal relationship we used to have with our tools." — Jonathan Pucky
			<br><br>
					“This new era challenges all of us—designers, engineers, business executives, and the public at large—to think differently about the relation between surface and substance, aesthetic and value.” — Virginia Postrelt</p></em>
					
					<p>When the personal computer entered the consumer market in the nineteen-eighties, everything changed. We essentially saw the complete democratisation of the personal computer, and it’s respective design tools. Followed by a full scale DIY culture in the offing, as a result of the global decentralisation of the computer from professional practice, to a consumer level product. The personal computer was introduced as an instrument of infinite possibilities. A palette of programs which could accommodate nearly any process with extremely fast turn around times. The computer was now made available to the general public to anyone and everyone who had A) the financial feasibility to purchase a machine as such. B) anyone who had an interest in personal computing, and C) any graphic designer, desktop publisher, and visual artist who was seeking to improve their practice by jumping on the bandwagon of the soon to be fully-digitalised culture. As Lorraine Wild states in her essay titled ‘Unravelling’; she explains this notion in it’s bare essence “as several others have observed, by the mid-1990’s the entire panoply of digitisation that pointed at editorial, imaging, design, and printing processes had been reinvented, and radically democratised the tools of design, so that anyone could jump in and make up until that point had been the territory of the trained (or of the trade)”.<a href="#1x16"> <sup>&nbsp16</sup></a></p>
			
					<p>In efforts of cultivating a better understanding of the production aspects and design in relation to form, and the multifaceted layers which production assumes within the contemporary practice of graphic design. We could first acknowledge the essential fact that this process has been strongly motivated by two things: Namely, the widespread adaptation to digitalisation and the democratisation of the personal computer and it’s digital mastery alike. And the Internet as a mechanism which has essentially become the breeding ground through which all culture is collected, cultivated, and contributed back to society. We look back in retrospect and conclude that these developments entirely reconfigured the hierarchy of the design practice. Who was the designer then? Who are the designers now? Who were the clients then? Who are the clients now? (do we even aim for clients, or are we our own clients? And what context or social benefit does the current body of graphic design encompass and contribute to society, and the progression of visual languages at large?) And how is mass digitalisation changing the way we work? If we are the creators of the tools, then we define how those tools behave. However, so long as we are using tools which are created by others; we also to some extent fall victim to the framework and limitations therein.</p>
							
					<p>In a recent essay written by Andrew Blauvelt titled “Tool (Or, Post-production of the Graphic Designer); he provides an in-depth look at the production aspects of design and how the development of new tools has allowed for us to discover new tangents in the field, and thus new visual and intellectual frameworks. Which through the benefit of new tools has allowed us to accelerate our practice on both a pragmatic level, as well as an intellectual level. And thus; contributing to the overall discourse in graphic design through the use and combining of design tools and techniques.<a href="#1x17"> <sup>&nbsp17</sup></a> In his essay he states the following notion: “Human use of tools has been theorised as an explanation for human evolution stimulating such things as increased brain size coupled with the unique human ability to mimic behaviour and thus spread ideas and techniques”. What Blauvelt is essentially pointing to in a concrete but simplistic way; is the fact that we as humans have had the possibility to develop ourselves through the action of exchanging ideas. Hence, the universal truth of: “The tool in effect transforms our material and virtual realities and, by doing so, it transforms us.”<a href="#1x18"> <sup>&nbsp18</sup></a></p>
					
					<p>Furthermore, Blauvelt continues to elaborate on a new generation of designers who’s practice revolves around the relation between Graphic Design and technology. This combination and skill set allows for the designer to carry a competence in his workflow by having the advantage of programming, and creating his own tools. “Jürg Lehni for instance wrote a scriptographer, a program that translates digital vectors to more analog devices such as Hektor, a robot-operated spray-paint device; Empty Words, a machine for making die-cut message posters; or Viktor, a chalk-drawing machine. Casey Reas and Ben Fry created Processing, an open source programming language that many other designers have used to create visualisations.”<a href="#1x19"> <sup>&nbsp19</sup></a></p>
					
					<p>So what does all this mean for the contemporary Graphic Designer? Looking at the current state of affairs in design and it’s relationship with other artistic disciplines and technology alike, Graphic Design often binds with other artistic disciplines or processes which advocate new kinds of ideation processes and exchange. Case in point being the relationship between Graphic Design and programming for instance. Where in recent years, programming and the whole notion of code as a new perspective has proven to be one of the most essential components of an ‘up to date’ design practice. By implementing the framework and behaviour which digitalisation delivers; we are able to not only see into new systems, but we are also able to intervene on them or create new ones through open-source software and the wizardry of open-source code. Through this, we are able to define new parameters on the agenda of design. Especially when we consider the emphasis on screen based design today. Which of course points to a completely different set of criteria and treatment than that of print based design. We are not only able to create new forms and new meanings within these digital frameworks. But we are also able to advance our workflows by automating tasks which the computer will carry out in a short amount of time, and almost flawlessly if conducted correctly. In the end, it comes down to being an asset to the discipline, and individual practice. The designer equips himself with the adequate tools and knowledge to function in the new era of design. And to embrace these changes by drawing out the benefits to further advance his profession. To create his own tools, and to understand the ways in which we work with in efforts of establishing new frameworks which contribute to new visual languages, and ultimately reflect the development of new forms to our existing surroundings.</p>
					
					<p>The aforementioned paragraph is a peephole into the vast industry of designers and programmers who aim to advance the design practice by allowing it to meet the character of it’s time. By releasing it from a strictly defined set of processes into a multidisciplinary arena of practice, research, and development. Dutch designer studios such as Moniker and Lust can be regarded as strong examples of this process combining both the visual, analytical, and social characteristics of graphic design; paired up with new frameworks governed by that of the digital industry. This again, offers designers in the practice the ability to extend passed the standard conventions by looking into new and interesting solutions in communication, with an equal emphasis between form, content, and craft. The following quoted paragraph by Blauvelt aims to elaborate further on the matter by starting with a quote by Lorraine Wild: “The meaning of our work is connected to how it is made, not just ‘concepted’”. For Wild, the ultimate value of craft is tied to how we view the world of graphic designers over many years and across disparate projects. It is the connective thread that makes sense of so much labor and identifies that body of work with a particular person: “When craft is put into the framework of graphic design, this might constitute what is meant by the ‘designer’s voice’—that part of design that is not industriously addressing the ulterior motives of a project, but instead follows the inner agenda of the designer’s craft. This guides the ‘body of work’ of a designer over and beyond the particular goal of each project. So craft is about tactics and concepts, seeking opportunities in the gaps of what is known, rather than trying to organise everything in unifying theory”.</p>
					
					<p>Furthermore, the meaning of production also expands onto territories which may even marginalise the designer and his practice. For instance the shift from print based design onto screen based design. And how this has essentially re-configured the way in which we perceive and treat form, content, and communication on a global scale. Additionally, the role of printed matter may also very well be threatened by the online and virtual arena. By services such as print-on-demand (Lulu and Blurb) are also signals that show a shift in the production process towards a economical solutions with little regard to the aesthetic value of the material object. And hence, the designer continues to become marginalised in his role, but through cause-and-effect; the designer and his practice revise, reshape, and adjust to these standards.<a href="#1x20"> <sup>&nbsp20</sup></a></p></p> 
					
					<p>However, with the full access and complete availability to the design tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign: We acknowledge the fact that a great deal of people — professional and young designers are in full control of what is produced, and where it is transmitted to. With hundreds of online blogs for the nameless curation of graphic design works: we see a venue in which form appears in every shape, style, color, scale, and function. While one might see this as a wave of pluralistic aesthetic ventures. Where styles and mediums seamlessly overlap. others such as Experimental Jetset embrace and justify this idea of “sameness” as a platform which may converge with the spurt of new aesthetic revelations in regards to graphic design and the substance of form. Experimental Jetset state that “When we think of the word “standard”, we always think of the way the word is used in the field of music: a blues standard, a jazz standard, a rock standards. What is interesting about standards is the fact that they can be used by every musician as a platform for a certain voice, a certain aesthetic. It is exactly the standards inherent “sameness” that becomes a stage for differences”.<a href="#1x21"> <sup>&nbsp21</sup></a><p>

	            <p><em>The problem is one of content. The misconception is that without deep content, design is reduced to pure style, a bag of dubious tricks. In graphic-design circles, form-follows-function is reconfigured to form-follows-content. If content is the source of 						form, always preceding it and imbuing it with meaning, form without content (as if that were even possible) is some kind of empty shell. - Michael Rock
				<br><br>
						But somewhere in the struggle to win the argument that design was about a great deal more than form, the profession ceased to make a compelling case for design as a formal activity. It is not that the commitment to form went away–it just went unspoken, 						like beauty itself. We are surrounded by it, but can’t bring ourselves to say what it is. In design, we have overlooked the degree to which beauty is a vital human need. It is an experience from which people have everything to gain and nothing to lose. - 						Rick Poynor
				<br><br>
						Suddenly design isn’t really about design anymore, and craft and form are depreciated in the face of “analysis” and “understanding”. This appears to be a halfhearted attempt to recast design as a primarily quantitive and analytics discipline. Yes, design 						is about analysis and problem solving, but it’s fundamental impact on the world (for better or worse) is in the artefacts of forms it produces. This is the only way ideas survive in design. To denigrate form and artefact making in design is to destroy it’s 						essence and reduce it to a generic role of think tank or consultant. - Randy Nakamura</p></em>
